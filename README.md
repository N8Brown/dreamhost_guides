# DreamHost Guides

The web-hosting service DreamHost allows users to host a variety of applications (PHP, Python, Node.js). While they have generally strong documentation for most topics, some are incomplete and/or require extra research. This repository seeks to compile fragmented process instructions into single, clear, and complete documents.
